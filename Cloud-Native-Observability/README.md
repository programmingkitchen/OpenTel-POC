This is the code repository for [Cloud-Native Observability with OpenTelemetry](https://www.packtpub.com/cloud-networking/cloud-native-observability-with-opentelemetry?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801077705), published by Packt.

**Learn to gain visibility into systems by combining tracing, metrics, and logging with OpenTelemetry**

## What is this book about?
Cloud-Native Observability with OpenTelemetry is a guide to helping you look for answers to questions about your applications. This book teaches you how to produce telemetry from your applications using an open standard to retain control of data. OpenTelemetry provides the tools necessary for you to gain visibility into the performance of your services. It allows you to instrument your application code through vendor-neutral APIs, libraries and tools. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the core concepts of OpenTelemetry
* Explore concepts in distributed tracing, metrics, and logging
* Discover the APIs and SDKs necessary to instrument an application using OpenTelemetry
* Explore what auto-instrumentation is and how it can help accelerate application instrumentation
* Configure and deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector
Get to grips with how different open-source backends can be used to analyze telemetry data
Understand how to correlate telemetry in common scenarios to get to the root cause of a problem

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
from opentelemetry._metrics import set_meter_provider
from opentelemetry.sdk._metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource

def configure_meter_provider():
  provider = MeterProvider(resource=Resource.create())
  set_meter_provider(provider)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  configure_meter_provider()
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for software engineers, library authors, and systems operators looking to better understand their infrastructure, services and applications by leveraging telemetry data like never before. Working knowledge of Python programming is assumed for the example applications that youâ€™ll be building and instrumenting using the OpenTelemetry API and SDK. Some familiarity with Go programming, Linux, and Docker is preferable to help you set up additional components in various examples throughout the book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-12 | OpenTelemetry for Python 1.9.0+ | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |
| 1-12 | OpenTelemetry Collector v0.42.0+ | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |

## Errata

* Page 29 (Figure 2.1): The port for the legacy-inventory should say **5001**
* Page 55 (Figure 2.5): The bubble between inventory API and inventory store should be labeled **4** instead of 3.
